                            Education prepares one to face the challenges of life by bringing out the best in him/her. If this is well accepted, education should be relevant to the needs of the time and address the problems of the day. 
                            Maverick also aims to bring a change in society by spreading awareness about conservation and effective utilization of resources, which shall bring discipline among individuals of all sections of the society.
                            As education lays the foundation of moral, social and ethical values, supporting education will only give rise to a civilized society in future.</p>

                <h2>Water Conservation & Climate Change</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai and 26 more cities of India are facing the worst water crisis ever since the independence.<br><br>
                    It is estimated that these cities might run out of groundwater by 2020.<br><br>
                    UN, in its report in the year 2015 claimed that this word will face a serious water crisis from the year 2025.<br><br>
                    This year, as a result of El Nino effect, pre-monsoon showers hit India later, resulting late rainfall. But, in states like Assam, Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Kerala, this rainfall turned out to be a nightmare, due to the devastating floods, which claimed countless lives and huge loss to human resources, natural resources, wildlife and agriculture.<br><br>
                    With so much of chaos being caused, doesn’t it give us a hunch? About the future, nearly water-less? Doesn’t it fear us? Isn’t it time to take a stand? For ourselves, and the future generation?<br><br>
                    India, which has inspired the world to respect and conserve the nature and its resources in the pre-medieval era, is unfortunately turning out to be among the bigger victims of Global Warming. Isn’t time to regain our lost legacy and pride? Isn’t it time that we take a stand again and lead the path in “reviving” mother earth?<br><br>
                    With nearly 60% of India’s population being youth, we need to play a crucial role in how we plan to conserve water and play an important role in sustainable development. Conservation of water and spreading awareness regarding it is the need of the hour and it is high time we take this initiative and give ourselves an assurance for creating a better future, for ourselves and our future generation. Our society and our nature, these two vital factors are the reason why we lead a convenient lifestyle. Being a citizen of India, it is our rightful duty to make a contribution for the society and for the nature.<br><br>
                    A single pair of denim pant takes nearly 7,600-10,000 litres of water to be made. To put that into perspective, its as good as a tank and a half of Kaveri water we are supplied at homes for household purposes, or 250-300 smartphones we possess, or a family may required for about 3 weeks, if not a month to be precise, or study material for a semester at least. With so much of water being utilised for a pair of cloth that we don’t wear it on regular basis, and which can be utilised for other productive meets, we should start asking ourselves, is the wastage worth it? And, isn’t it wastage of huge amount of water when we decide to dump it off after a while?<br><br>
                    This legacy of denim pants had begun way back in the 1880s. And today, nearly 130 years later, denims are something nearly entire youth engages to(almost a bare necessity). Now that we know the amount of water being used for a pair of denims, it might take years to spread awareness regarding it and only reduce the sales and usage of denims among us, and maybe decades to put a complete full stop over usage of it. But, what about the denims that have been made? How to utilise the amount of water that has been utilised, for a better use?<br><br>
                    According to a report in 2016 by the Government of India, they have acknowledged that they are short of facilitating school bags for the government school children. Even today, many children miss out on educational opportunities or drop out of their schools owing many factors, few of them being, poor financial conditions, the most common reason, due to which they can’t afford books or school fees, lack of proper infrastructure, lack of sanitation facilities, and many more. But there was another strange, yet a true reason for dropping out of schools, lack of school bags. Isn’t that unfortunate? What can be done for it?<br><br><br>
                    Maverick thought of both these serious concerns and came up with on solution, convert used denims into school bags and provide the underprivileged children with it. Maverick believes that education is a human right for a child and none of them should be deprived of it. They are the future of the nation and they need our support today. Our nation can’t afford to have illiteracy and water crisis when we boast about being the fastest growing economy in the world, when we see ourselves as the third largest economy by 2030, when we aspire of being a world superpower by the year 2037. All of this and “Sabka saath, Sabka Vikas” (Everyone’s support, Everyone’s development) is definitely possible if we help them today.<br><br>
                    Maverick has made it simple for you to contribute to society and nature by just one small contribution, donating used denims. This small contribution will not just help us use the water  utilised for a better use, but also support a child’s education which will further contribute to a better future of not just them, but a better and a developed India.<br><br>
